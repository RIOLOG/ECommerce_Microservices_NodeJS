# eCommerce Microservices with Node.js

This project is a demonstration of a microservices architecture for an eCommerce website developed using Node.js. It features a collection of independent services communicating through HTTP and utilizing a load balancer for scalability and reliability. Services are registered and discovered using Consul, providing seamless integration and communication between them.

## Features

- User Authentication
- Product Catalog Management
- Order Processing
- Load Balancing for Scalability
- Service Registration and Discovery with Consul

## Architecture Overview

The architecture of this project consists of multiple independent microservices, each responsible for a specific aspect of the eCommerce system. These services communicate through HTTP APIs and are managed by a load balancer for distributing incoming traffic across multiple instances. Consul is used for service registration and discovery, ensuring seamless communication between services.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Docker (for running Consul and Load Balancer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/ecommerce-microservices.git
Install dependencies for each service:

bash
Copy code
cd ecommerce-microservices/service-name
npm install
Running the Services
Start Consul and Load Balancer:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
Start each microservice:

bash
Copy code
cd ecommerce-microservices/service-name
npm start
Usage
Once the services are running, you can interact with them through their respective APIs. Use tools like Postman or cURL to make HTTP requests to the endpoints provided by each service. Ensure that Consul and the load balancer are running to facilitate service discovery and load balancing.
